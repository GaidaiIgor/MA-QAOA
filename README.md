# MA-QAOA
Implementation of the original Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and Multi-Angle QAOA (MA-QAOA).

Both algorithms are designed to find approximate solutions to combinatorial optimization problems on quantum computers. 

This implementation is purely classical, so it only calculates expectation values and does not give explicit answers to the combinatorial problems (since this usually requires a quantum computer).

See basic usage examples in `basic_examples.py`
